# 💻 Flupy — Frontend Application (`/app`)

This directory contains the Next.js web interface for the Flupy Protocol.

The app handles browser-side ZK proof generation, Freighter wallet integration,
Merkle proof retrieval, contract root synchronization, Soroban transaction submission,
progress UX, error mapping, telemetry, and local transaction history.

> ⚠️ **Testnet Notice**
>
> This application currently connects to Stellar Testnet only.
> Flupy is a production-candidate Testnet implementation, not a mainnet financial product.
>
> The current on-chain verifier uses a demo-mode backend while browser-side
> `snarkjs.groth16.verify()` is enforced before every contract submission.
> See [`../SECURITY.md`](../SECURITY.md) for current limitations.

## 🚦 Current Status

**Phase 3D — Production Testnet E2E + Full SDK Integration**

The deployed Vercel frontend successfully:

- loads Groth16 circuit artifacts from production static assets,
- generates Groth16 proofs in the browser,
- verifies proofs locally before submission,
- checks Merkle root synchronization against the Soroban contract,
- signs transactions through Freighter,
- submits Soroban `execute_payment` calls,
- confirms transactions on Stellar Testnet,
- persists local transaction history in the browser.

## ⚙️ Environment Configuration

Create `app/.env.local`:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ID=CAGJIQ4W5Q7ZAYJ2QLH4M4TRIZJHFSDDJZ43PYAR4QEZVP76FTBDIBAS
NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL=https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org:443
NEXT_PUBLIC_HORIZON_URL=https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org
NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK_PASSPHRASE=Test SDF Network ; September 2015

NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN=
SENTRY_ORG=
SENTRY_PROJECT=
SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=

NEXT_PUBLIC_TRACE=false
```

### Notes

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ID` points to the current Stellar Testnet Soroban contract.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK_PASSPHRASE` is used for chainId binding.
- Sentry variables are optional in local development.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_TRACE=true` enables internal trace logs in development.

<a id="key-source-files"></a>

## 🔑 Key Source Files

### `src/hooks/useFlupy.ts`

Stable app-level orchestration hook.

Responsibilities:

- wallet connection state
- credential status checks
- credential setup
- payment execution
- proof progress state
- root sync validation
- local verification flow
- Freighter signing trigger
- transaction status handling
- Sentry capture
- internal telemetry
- history update
- user-facing logs

This hook intentionally remains the stable app path while `@flupy/react` adoption happens incrementally.

---

### `src/lib/merkle.ts`

Browser-side Merkle API client wrapper.

Responsibilities:

- commitment generation
- testnet/mock enrollment request
- Merkle proof request
- frontend logging for proof retrieval

Endpoints used:

```text
POST /api/merkle-proof/enroll
POST /api/merkle-proof
```

---

### `src/lib/stellar.ts`

Soroban transaction layer.

Responsibilities:

- proof byte validation
- ScVal encoding
- Freighter signing
- Soroban simulation
- transaction submission
- transaction polling
- contract root retrieval through `/api/merkle-root`

Contract function:

```text
execute_payment(from, to, amount, pi_a, pi_b, pi_c, public_inputs)
```

---

### `src/lib/errorMapper.ts`

Maps technical errors into user-friendly messages.

Examples:

| Error Pattern | User Message |
|---|---|
| `Error(Contract, #4)` | Payment proof was already used |
| `Error(Contract, #12)` | Enrollment state changed / root mismatch |
| `RootSyncError` | Contract Merkle root is out of sync |
| wrong password / corrupted credential | Wrong password or recreate credential |
| Freighter rejected | Transaction was cancelled |
| artifact 404 | Circuit artifact missing or deployment issue |

---

### `src/lib/history.ts`

Local transaction history layer.

Responsibilities:

- stores transaction metadata only
- persists across refresh
- stores status: `pending`, `success`, `failed`
- stores explorer URL
- avoids storing secrets, passwords, or raw proofs

Storage:

```text
IndexedDB
```

---

### `src/lib/telemetry.ts`

Lightweight internal tracing.

Example trace steps:

```text
credential:decrypt
merkle:request
merkle:received
proof:start
proof:generating
proof:done
wallet:sign_request
tx:submit
tx:confirmed
tx:failed
trace:summary
```

Tracing is local and does not persist sensitive data.

---

### `src/lib/sentryCapture.ts`

Sentry payment error capture helper.

Security rules:

- wallet addresses are masked
- secrets are not captured
- raw proofs are not captured
- circuit inputs are not captured
- amount and tx hash may be included as non-secret metadata

---

<a id="circuit-artifacts"></a>

## 📦 Circuit Artifacts

Production circuit artifacts are served from:

```text
/circuit/v3/flupy_payment.wasm
/circuit/v3/circuit_final.zkey.bin
/circuit/v3/verification_key.json
```

The proving key is served as:

```text
circuit_final.zkey.bin
```

instead of:

```text
circuit_final.zkey
```

for Vercel static deployment compatibility.

### Required Local Files

```text
app/public/circuit/v3/flupy_payment.wasm
app/public/circuit/v3/circuit_final.zkey.bin
app/public/circuit/v3/verification_key.json
```

### Local Artifact Check

```bash
curl -I http://localhost:3000/circuit/v3/flupy_payment.wasm
curl -I http://localhost:3000/circuit/v3/circuit_final.zkey.bin
curl -I http://localhost:3000/circuit/v3/verification_key.json
```

Expected:

```text
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```

### Production Artifact Check

```bash
curl -I https://flupy.vercel.app/circuit/v3/flupy_payment.wasm
curl -I https://flupy.vercel.app/circuit/v3/circuit_final.zkey.bin
curl -I https://flupy.vercel.app/circuit/v3/verification_key.json
```

Expected:

```text
HTTP/2 200
```

Observed production artifact sizes:

```text
flupy_payment.wasm       = 2,243,297 bytes
circuit_final.zkey.bin    = 5,913,232 bytes
verification_key.json     = 4,028 bytes
```

<a id="api-routes"></a>

## 🌐 API Routes Used by Frontend

### `POST /api/merkle-proof/enroll`

Enrolls a commitment into the current Testnet Merkle tree.

This endpoint is used for mock/Testnet onboarding and does not receive raw secrets.

---

### `POST /api/merkle-proof`

Returns a Merkle membership proof for an enrolled commitment.

Response includes:

```json
{
  "pathElements": [],
  "pathIndices": [],
  "root": "..."
}
```

The returned root is used as the Merkle proof root.

---

### `GET /api/merkle-root`

Returns the active Merkle root stored in the Soroban contract.

This endpoint is used by the frontend root sync guard before proof generation.

---

<a id="merkle-root-synchronization"></a>

## 🔐 Merkle Root Synchronization

Before proof generation, the frontend compares:

1. Merkle proof root from `/api/merkle-proof`
2. Contract root from `/api/merkle-root`

If the values differ, proof generation is stopped.

This prevents:

- stale proof generation
- wasted proving time
- `RootMismatch` contract failures

Verified root sync evidence:

```text
Contract root:

01d36b99df9115ab2d12fc7a0d8ad24c73e1f0e99a8186161b30bd0981756972

Merkle proof root decimal:

825860214526777548768231888040603757085006455794519490744185581216954935666

Decimal root converted to hex:

01d36b99df9115ab2d12fc7a0d8ad24c73e1f0e99a8186161b30bd0981756972
```

Result:

```text
frontend/backend Merkle root == on-chain contract Merkle root
```

---

<a id="frontend-security-architecture"></a>

## 🔒 Frontend Security Architecture

### Cross-Origin Isolation

The app enables COOP/COEP headers for WASM and browser proof generation compatibility:

```ts
{ key: "Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy", value: "same-origin" },
{ key: "Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy", value: "require-corp" },
```

---

### Identity Privacy

- Raw credential never leaves the browser.
- Backend receives commitment only.
- Password is never stored.
- Password is never logged.
- Raw secret is never logged.
- Raw secret is not stored in React state.
- Credential is encrypted in IndexedDB using PBKDF2 + AES-GCM.

---

### Proof Privacy

- Proof generation happens locally in the browser.
- Local proof verification runs before transaction submission.
- Raw proof data is not logged by the React SDK.
- Only encoded proof bytes and public signals are sent to the contract.

---

### Transaction Safety

- User signs through Freighter.
- Frontend validates Freighter network.
- Contract checks nullifier, root, recipient hash, chainId, and amount constraints.
- Transaction history stores metadata only.
- Explorer links point to Stellar Testnet.

---

### Error Safety

The app maps technical errors to user-facing messages.

Examples:

- wrong password
- Freighter rejected
- contract paused
- nullifier already spent
- root mismatch
- invalid proof
- network mismatch
- artifact missing

Raw stack traces are retained only in developer console for debugging.

<a id="current-frontend-limitations"></a>

## 🚧 Current Frontend Limitations

The frontend is production-candidate for Stellar Testnet, but not mainnet-ready.

Known limitations:

- proof generation currently runs on the browser main thread,
- artifact checksum validation is not yet implemented,
- offline artifact preload is not yet implemented,
- mobile performance testing is not yet complete,
- API rate limiting is not yet production-hardened,
- persistent Merkle storage is not yet deployed,
- incremental `@flupy/react` app integration is complete (SDK-1C-6A through 6D validated on Testnet),
- native on-chain BN254 pairing verification is still pending Soroban SDK support.

---

<a id="next-frontend-milestones"></a>

## 🗺️ Next Frontend Milestones

### 1. Runtime Hardening

- Move Groth16 proof generation into a Web Worker.
- Add proof generation timeout handling.
- Add cancellation-safe proof lifecycle.
- Add artifact checksum validation for WASM, ZKey, and verification key.
- Add offline artifact preload.

### 2. UX Hardening

- Improve proof progress estimation.
- Improve error recovery actions.
- Add better credential reset UX.
- Improve mobile layout and test on Android/iOS browsers.

### 3. SDK Integration (Complete — SDK-1C-6)

- ✅ `useFlupyHistory` — localStorage persistence (SDK-1C-6A)
- ✅ `useFlupyWallet` — Freighter bridge (SDK-1C-6B)
- ✅ `FlupyProvider` — context in /app subtree via providers.tsx (SDK-1C-6C)
- ✅ `useFlupyPayment` — experimental SDK path E2E confirmed on Testnet (SDK-1C-6D)

Both the primary payment path (`executeFlupyPayment`) and SDK hook path
(`useFlupyPayment`) are confirmed on Stellar Testnet with valid on-chain
95/5 atomic splits.

### 4. Observability

- Complete Sentry environment configuration.
- Add production-safe error grouping.
- Add transaction trace IDs to payment failure reports.
- Prepare future Datadog/OpenTelemetry integration.
